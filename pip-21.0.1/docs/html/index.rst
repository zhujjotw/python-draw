   In pip 20.3, we've `made a big improvement to the heart of pip`_;
   :ref:`Resolver changes 2020`. We want your input, so `sign up for
   our user experience research studies`_ to help us do it right.

.. warning::

   pip 21.0, in January 2021, removed Python 2 support, per pip's
   :ref:`Python 2 Support` policy. Please migrate to Python 3.
